            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
            </p>
            <p>

            0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <strong>shannon@consciouslynaturalmomma.com.</strong><br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:<br>
            We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
            12.<strong> Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) </strong> <br>
