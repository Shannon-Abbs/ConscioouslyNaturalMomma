            <h1>What Miscarriage is Like - From a Woman Who Experienced One </h1>

            <p>
             The hard truth is, sometimes the tough events in life come in the form of miscarriage for some women. 1 in 4 is the miscarriage statistic in the United States after all.
            However, many women just deal with the pain and don't talk about the experience. 
            </p>
            <p>Losing a pregnancy at any stage can be a very heartbreaking and confusing time. We all deal with grief differently. 
            That, and people just don't want to hear about or understand miscarriage. Save it for the therapist, am I right?</p>
            <p> This may lead to not really knowing how to offer support to a woman coping with miscarriage. Which can also make healing even more difficult to achieve. 
            </p>

            <p>Today, I'm here to talk about my experience with pregnancy loss with a little story time. I believe we need to talk about our heartaches once in a while. 
              Talking about my miscarriage was unfortunately met with a lot of annoyance among my peers. So, writing about it to offer my real-life point of view 
            has given me time to grieve and heal but also, help other women in the process. 
            </p>
            <p>So, thanks for reading.</p>

            <h2>What's In This Post?</h2>
            <p>
              Let me give you some insight on how my miscarriage went. Every woman is different of course but talking about our pregnancy loss is a 
              great way to learn from each other.

            <p>Allow me to elaborate... I'll try to keep this to a short read.</p>

            <h2>Trying to Conceive</h2>
            <p>
              I told J. I wanted to have a baby. I was so embarrassed but I was sure he was the one for me and I was struck with baby fever.
            </p>
            <p>At first, I was just trying to be chill about it. One month went by and I was bummed but carried on. Two, three, and four months 
              went on of us trying to conceive and it just wasn't happening. 
              </p>
            <p>
              That's when I started wondering <a href="https://consciouslynaturalmomma.com/motherhood/pregnancy/how-conceiving-a-baby-naturally-actually-happens.html" target="_blank"><strong>how natural pregnancy conception works</strong></a>
              and learned about how my body worked. I thought we were just supposed to have sex without birth control and that was it, done deal.
            </p>
            <p>Boy was I misinformed.</p> 
            
            <p>I used the <a href="https://www.oviahealth.com/apps/" target="_blank"><strong>Ovia Health App</strong></a> to track my cycles and I was able to pinpoint the right times to have sex and got a greater understanding of my body. 
            There are also other anonymous women who have shared their experiences and I learned <a href="https://consciouslynaturalmomma.com/motherhood/pregnancy/5-conception-tips.html" target="_blank"><strong>tips on how to conceive naturally.</strong></a>
              </p>
              <p>
              Those months eventually turned into a year, then that year passed by. At that point, I was absolutely obsessed with baby making and could not get it off my mind.
              </p>

            <h2>Two Lines on a Stick</h2>
            <p>Now, all that time trying to conceive had me getting very antsy and I was doing everything I could to make it happen already!
              Which included buying a large pack of <a href="https://amzn.to/44cU1NW" target="_blank"
              ><strong>ovulation and pregnancy sticks.</strong></a> Because at that point I was tired of paying top dollar to pee on a stick of paper.
              </p> 
              <p>
                One day while out of town, I had been doing yoga on my roommates porch and I just <em>knew</em> I just wasn't pregnant again.
              I was down on myself, had the pms blues and just was ready to give up. This journey was so taxing.
            </p>

              <p>My roommate had gone out with friends and I was going to my shift at the club (more on that in my<a href="../../shop/book/" target="_blank"
                ><strong> book.😉</strong></a>). I was due to do a test so I peed on a stick and set it on the counter before my shower. When I got out I was 
                immensely surprised to see the result was <em>TWO LINES!</em> Which is exactly what us "trying to conceive" ladies are hoping to see!
            </p>
            <p>
              There was enough HCG (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin" target="_blank"><strong>pregnancy hormones</strong></a>) in my urine to show a positive on the test! So surely I was pregnant!
              I was so excited I screamed and promptly hid the test in my suitcase where it couldn't be found.

            <h2>A Few Days:</h2>
            <p>I ate dinner, walked to the bus stop and was absolutely STARVING. I consulted the app ladies, "Welcome to being pregnant! Congrats!" many of them typed.
            </p>
            <p>I worked for a few nights and had a good time. I was so excited and happy that I made great tips. And was lost in daydream of how I'd tell J.</p>

            <h2>The App & The Bath:</h2>
            <p>I was at my last night of work and a customer who had talked to me earlier that week walked up. He *shocked* commented on how skinny my arms had gotten over the week. 
              Which completely threw me off guard because I (embarrassingly) didn't recognize him at first and it was a weird comment. 
            </p>
            <p>Shrugged that off, went home and the next day I was due for the train ride back home.
            </p>
            <p>My roommate was at work so I was alone chillin' on the couch writing in my journal to my future baby. I nicknamed them "silly goose" for some reason.
              When suddenly I felt what feels like blood in my underwear.</p>
              <p>There it was. On the couch and on my pants. I was terrified but thought "maybe it's just spotting". 
                So, I consulted the <a href="https://www.oviahealth.com/apps/" target="_blank"><strong>app</strong></a> ladies and got in the bath. I was having strong cramps out of nowhere.
              </p>
              <p>I sat on the toilet and there was more blood. I cried. I knew what was happening. I laid in the bath squirming because of the pain. It was much more sudden and intense than my normal "moon cycle" cramps.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure I was just crying in this bath completely unsure, confused, terrified and all knowing at the same time.
                I let the bath run cold as I just laid there. 
                </p>
                <p>No fancy bubbles. No bath bombs.
              </p>
              <p>I get out of the bath, pick up the phone and the messages read "You need to call the hospital right now!".
              </p>
              <p>Confused as to why, I called anyway.</p>

            <h2>The Hospital:</h2>
            <p>I called my home town hospital and they explained that I needed to go because if I was pregnant
               or not they needed to test my blood to make sure it wasn't RH positive or negative. 
              To read about why that's important click 
              <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/the-rh-factor-how-it-can-affect-your-pregnancy" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a>
            </p>
            <p>They called the nearest hospital to me and told me how to get there. My roommate was still at work so I had to ask the other roommate there to drive me. 
              I did so very shyly. He didn't ask questions, drove and stayed with me until they called my name.  
            </p>
            <p>I told each person what was happening, they took blood out of my arm, and I laid there shivering.
              I got up a few times to pee and each time there was more blood. But none on my underwear like a normal cycle. 
            </p>
            <p>Two hours went by and a woman finally came in to tell me my blood type is A- and my HCG levels were at 9.
              That 9 meant I was pregnant but HCG levels go up greatly (in the 100's) each day of pregnancy until the second trimester hits. That number usually evens out and stays then. 
              A 9 also confirmed that this wasn't just my cycle because the HCG wouldn't have read anything at all if it was.
            </p>
           <p>I asked her if I was having a miscarriage and she just stared at me dead in the eyes, no words, expressionless. 
            As if I were wasting her time.
           </p>
           <p>I was discharged, the roommate and I left. I felt defeated, confused and empty.</p>
            
           <h2>Trying to Talk & Heal:</h2>
           <p>I told nobody. I got on the train quietly. I sat with my hood up, and cried. I didn't get to download the movie I wanted to watch earlier anyway.
            I was going in and out of denial. The lady didn't <em>say</em> I was having a miscarriage. 
            I thought "Maybe it was just a freak accident. Many women have period like symptoms at first."
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew though. I carried out the rest of the miscarriage in the tiny bathroom, of an 8 hour train ride. Alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't tell J. right away. I was just dealing with it all. The physical pain wasn't so bad and I got the courage to tell him. He didn't say or do anything. I realized later that's how <em>he</em> copes with hardships.
              I needed him, I cried in his lap. He picked up the video game controller and continued playing behind my head. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I would have crying spells where I just couldn't get off the floor crying (the real ugly kind). I started sobbing in a grocery store because I heard a baby cry. It was completely involuntary.(Why would I want that?) But I got the sense that when I told people they thought I was being dramatic. 
            </p>
            <p>My peers said things like: it wasn't a baby, it was just my cycle (it wasn't), I was making it up for attention, not a big deal and that I'm not the only one so suck it up already.
            </p>
             <p> Not exactly the support I needed in that moment. Also, gave me a sense of who really gave a <s>fuck</s> about me.
            </p>

            <h2>Moving Forward:</h2>
            <p>I got a different job as a housekeeper and tried to get my head straight. Months went on and I slowly started feeling better, less crying to my friends about how I just wanted a baby. 
             </p>
             <p> I had purchased a web development course a few months later and thought maybe I should give up trying to conceive and have a <em>"real"</em> career instead.
              "Maybe that's what the Universe wants for me" I thought.
            </p>
            <p>I told J. I didn't want to try anymore and that I'd like to focus on school. I felt like I needed to do something different with my life.
              Maybe I wasn't really ready for the baby anyway.
            </p>
            <p>And when I gave up, J. "forgot" as he put it, and we fell pregnant with W. 6 months after the miscarriage. (You can read that full beautiful story 
              <a href="../../shop/book/" target="_blank"><strong> here.</strong></a></em>)
              <p>My first thoughts initially were fear of miscarriage. I was hesitant to tell J. or anyone, rightfully so. My doctor at the time had allowed me a blood test pretty early on to confirm. Which isn't the norm but so kind of them.
                I guess I got to have my "Rainbow Baby" instead.
              </p>
            <p>I eventually healed enough to realize that this was heartbreaking 
              and so hard while it was happening but the Universe tests us in mysterious ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided that I needed to weather that storm to:<br>
               A. Figure out if really truly wanted this baby. All those tears say I did.
               <br>
              B. Lead me to Web Development. Which eventually not only lead me to writing the<a href="../../shop/book/" target="_blank"><strong> Consciously Natural Momma Book</strong></a></em>
              but also lead me here to help other women like you.
            </p>
            <p>I truly needed this & baby W. later proved to save my life.</p>
           

            <h2>Wrap Up:</h2>
            <p>If you or anyone has weathered the painful storm of miscarriage or pregnancy loss then know that I'm here. I get you. The pain isn't just physical the miscarriage healing process cannot be only explained in textbook version advice.

            </p>
            <p>There are many pregnancy loss support groups out there if you don't have support around you. You will heal eventually and time will allow you to process.

            </p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed reading my personal experience on coping with miscarriage and my symptoms. As well as, learning what to do if it happens to you.
               </p>
